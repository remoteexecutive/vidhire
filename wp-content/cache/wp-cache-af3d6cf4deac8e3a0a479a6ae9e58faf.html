<h2><b>Present State of the Hiring Industry</b></h2>
<p>Recruiters and hiring managers are overwhelmed by the volume of résumés pouring in, thanks to the weak job market and new tools that let applicants apply for a job with as little as one mouse click. The professional networking website LinkedIn recently introduced an “apply now” button on its job postings that sends the data in a job seeker’s profile directly to a potential employer.</p>
<p>While job boards and networking websites help companies broadcast openings to a wide audience, potentially increasing the chance the perfect candidate will reply, the resulting flood of applications tends to include a lot of duds. Most recruiters report that at least 50% of job hunters don’t possess the basic qualifications for the jobs they are pursuing.</p>
<p>To cut through the clutter, many large and midsize companies have turned to applicant-tracking systems to search résumés for the right skills and experience. The systems, which can cost from $5,000 to millions of dollars, are efficient, but not foolproof.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.beyond.com/articles/why-employers-use-an-applicant-tracking-system-11597-article.html">Beyond</a>, a recent study by software consulting company,<a href="http://www.softwareadvice.com/hr/buyerview/ats-report-2014/">Software Advice</a>, found that “While the number of companies utilizing manual methods has declined since last year, 61 percent of their customers were managing their applicants with spreadsheets and email. Most of the companies surveyed were in the small business sector (76 percent).</p>
<p>VidHire’s full-service, in depth pre-screening of applicants reduces your choice to a handful of applicants offering a top and second pick based on an evaluation criteria specific to you job requirements. Easy to use, fast, reliable and effective VidHire outperforms the top applicant tracking software for free, offering full-service, per minute billing at from $15 to $28 per hour depending on the package.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Listening Skills Evaluation</strong></p>
<p>Did the applicant quickly recap the key points they mentioned as being important.</p>
<p><strong>Questioning Skills Evaluation</strong></p>
<p>Number of questions asked to identify need.  Rating 1 for each question</p>
<p>What goals are you striving to achieve this quarter?”</p>
<p>“What challenges are you experiencing trying to reach those targets?”</p>
<p>“What are those problems costing you in terms of lost revenue, customers, market share, etc.?”</p>
<p>“What impact is that having on your business? On you?”</p>
<p>“How important is this project compared to the others on your plate?”</p>
<p>“What internal challenges do you need to deal with before this project gets the go-ahead?”</p>
<p><strong>Pauses and Confusion: Neg 2 points</strong> “Um, I’d like to, uh, discuss how our service can, um, help you, uh, reduce employee turnover.”</p>
<p><strong>Over Selling Negative 2 points,</strong>  Including far too much information in their presentations and open them by talking about their company instead of the buyer’s situation. Resist the “include everything but the kitchen sink” approach and</p>
<p><strong>Balanced Presentation (1 point)</strong>  The applicant only discussed the aspects of your offering that are critical for your prospect to know.</p>
<p><strong>Time Consideration:</strong>  Did the applicant manage to present the product info in the desired time.  the more critical it is that you verbally rehearse that presentation.</p>
<p><strong>Confidence (1 point)</strong>  Watch body language, gestures, and facial expressions.</p>
<p>Closing Request:  Early,  1 point 2 closing requests 2 points</p>
<p>Requesting a Commitment:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How much time to you need to think about working with VidHire?</p>
<p>Would 5 days be enough.  Is it ok if I call you around that time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Rapport-building</h1>
<p>Talk about a photo on the desk or an award on their wall…that approach is severely outdated.</p>
<p>Demonstrate that you understand the business problem they face.</p>
<p>Outlining the goal of your sales call, confirming the time that’s been allotted and then finishing early.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Objection Handling</h1>
<p><strong>Empathize (1 point) </strong> Did the applicant show you understanding, respect or appreciation of the customers concern. “Mr. Smith, I understand that you have budget issues to deal with.”</p>
<p><strong>Clarify (1 point)  </strong> Did the applicant restate the objection in your own words to ensure that the applicant clearly understand the objection “So you see the value in this product, it’s just that the purchase exceeds the budget you had allotted, correct?”</p>
<p><strong>Seek Permission (1 point)  </strong> “Mr. Smith, would it be okay if I took a minute to discuss a few options?”</p>
<ul>
<li>I know it is difficult to implement systems company wide.  What if we start with just one job offer to see how it goes.?</li>
<li>Just the hourly service without commitment. $28 per hour under 5 hours,   5 to 10 hour $27 per hour,  10 to 20 hours $26 per hour.   20 to 40 $25 hours</li>
<li>Bigger the package the less the rate&#8230;.</li>
<li>VH &#8211; The optimum company hires one employee per month or more.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Persistence</h1>
<p>Persistence means finding creative ways to keep your name in your prospect’s mind.</p>
<p>Would you like us to inform you of system advancements and service offers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://vidhire.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ApplicantTrackingSystem.png"><img class="alignright wp-image-336 size-medium" src="http://vidhire.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ApplicantTrackingSystem-300x257.png" alt="ApplicantTrackingSystem" width="300" height="257" /></a>A zero to five rating is applied to skills, education, career map, references, video interview and tests. The evaluator is looking to rate these aspects of the applicants data to create an overall evaluation and a detailed comparison of applicants. Once a rating is applied the system will automatically sort by rating.</p>
<p><strong>Grade A+ Players</strong> (rating 5) Consistent top performers. Innovative, passionate, high energy, takes pride in quality of work.</p>
<p><strong>Grade A Players</strong> (rating 4) Top performer similar to in motivation and production A+ but weak in a few areas such as emotional issues or lack of teamsmanship.</p>
<p><strong>Grade B+ Players</strong> (rating 3) Solid consistent performers with well rounded skill sets. Motivated and energetic but not as productive as the A players.</p>
<p><strong>Grade B Players</strong> (rating 2) Above average performers with a few weaknesses that demand more managements support.</p>
<p><strong>Grade C+ Players</strong> (rating 1) Not a fast performer, but consistent, slower to learn new tasks or skills,  usually needing direction.</p>
<p><strong>Grade C Players</strong> (rating 0) Adequate performance but just that and no more, basically do what they are told and need to be told to do the job.</p>
<h2>Positive Adjustment &#8211; Rating 0 -5</h2>
<p>This is for secondary reviews or weight adjustment. For example, the applicant lives 2 miles from the office, or he/she has a quality that demand a higher positive rating.</p>
<h2>Grade A+ Players &#8211; Rating 5</h2>
<p>Grade A + are consistent top performers with very few weaknesses.  This rare breed is a small percent of the workforce, only one in twenty, usually the top or second highest student in their class. They are a quick study, like problem solving and challenges to their intelligence. They often natural leaders by setting a standard of performance for others aspire to. They are energetic, fast paced and driven to succeed. Just doing the job is not an option it has to be completed with excellence. They define themselves by what they do and feel good about it and consistently exceed performance expectations. The like a team effort is value is being share and usually hate slacker.  Usually they are ready to collaborate and make sure they are giving value to a team.  Grade A player usually do not stay in companies that are restrictive to growth, without mental challenge and have many low performers as work becomes frustrating and the lack of energy, suffocating. If you company does not appreciate creativity, innovation, and passion, forget trying to entice and hold A or A + players.</p>
<h2>Rating System Advantages</h2>
<ol>
<li>Evaluators document why the rating was given breaking the selection process down to several values.  HR personnel often go on gut instinct and often cannot repeat to the department heads why they chose the applicant over others.  This rating system records the section process of past hires.</li>
<li>The VidHire rating systems is unbiased as it looks at just one component at a time.</li>
<li>The VidHire rating system allows for different parties to review and adjust evaluations.</li>
</ol>
<h2> Skills Rating</h2>
<p><strong>Rating 5:</strong> Applicant&#8217;s skills show rapid advancement, creativity, and diversity? (A+ Player)</p>
<p><strong>Rating 4:</strong> Applicant&#8217;s skills show high intelligence and familiarity of the most needed skills.  (A Player)</p>
<p><strong>Rating 3:</strong> Applicant&#8217;s skills show high intelligence and familiarity of the most needed skills.  (B+ Player)</p>
<p><strong>Rating 2:</strong> Applicant&#8217;s skills    (B Player)</p>
<p><strong>Rating 1: </strong>Applicant&#8217;s skills  (C+ Player)</p>
<p><strong>Rating 0:</strong> Applicants skills listed show capacity to do the job but nothing impressive.  (C Player)</p>
